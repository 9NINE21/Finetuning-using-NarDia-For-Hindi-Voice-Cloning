# Hindi Voice Cloning using Open-Source TTS Models

This repository contains experiments and findings from building a Hindi TTS voice cloning pipeline using open-source models like Nari-DIA 1.6B, Coqui XTTS, and Microsoft SpeechT5. The work focuses on evaluating zero-shot capabilities, fine-tuning using Hindi datasets, and addressing limitations in Hindi synthesis.

## üîç Models Explored

### 1. Nari-DIA 1.6B 
Original Repo for this model : https://github.com/nari-labs/dia.git
## üíª Hardware and Inference Speed

Dia has been tested on only GPUs (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.6). CPU support is to be added soon.
The initial run will take longer as the Descript Audio Codec also needs to be downloaded.

## ‚úÖ Tested Zero-shot Voice Cloning of Nari-Dia 1.6B using the Custom Voices   
## Results Summary : Audio at [results/zeroshot_outputs/]
## üîä Results Summary
| Model         | Type        | Hindi Quality | Notes                               | English Quality |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Nari-DIA      | Zero-shot   | ‚ùå Poor        | Lacks Hindi phoneme training       |    Good         |

## ‚úÖ Finetuning Attempted using:  
  - Finetune Refrence Repo : https://github.com/stlohrey/dia-finetuning.git
  - Dataset: `Rishavnine/SYSPIN_Hindi_Male_TTS_Small` HuggingFace Link : https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rishavnine/SYSPIN_Hindi_Male_TTS_Small
  - Platform: Kaggle 
  - Finetuning Scripts at The Finetuning
  - Checkpoints at results/finetuining-checkpoints
    
## üîä Results Summary

| Model         | Type        | Hindi Quality | Notes                                |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Nari-DIA      | Finetuned   | ‚ùì Unknown     | Checkpoint corrupted during transfer |

 -Gradio url not Supported by the Kaggle So checkpoint transfer to the kaggle CheckPoint Corrupted not working properly 

### 2. Coqui XTTS
- Original Repo for this model : https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS.git
- Documentation information with Finetuning https://docs.coqui.ai/en/latest/models/xtts.html
- Colab link at models-CoquiXTTS
  ## üîä Results Summary
- ‚úÖ Tried running fine-tuning Colab.
- ‚ùå Colab Broken (Dependency issues unstable Broken Resources Everywhere)
- Not usable locally due to hardware limitations (24GB VRAM).
