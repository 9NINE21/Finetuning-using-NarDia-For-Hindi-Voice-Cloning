# Hindi Voice Cloning using Open-Source TTS Models

This repository contains experiments and findings from building a Hindi TTS voice cloning pipeline using open-source models like Nari-DIA 1.6B, Coqui XTTS, and Microsoft SpeechT5. The work focuses on evaluating zero-shot capabilities, fine-tuning using Hindi datasets, and addressing limitations in Hindi synthesis.

## üîç Models Explored

### 1. Nari-DIA 1.6B 
Original Repo for this model : https://github.com/nari-labs/dia.git
## üíª Hardware and Inference Speed

Dia has been tested on only GPUs (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.6). CPU support is to be added soon.
The initial run will take longer as the Descript Audio Codec also needs to be downloaded.

These are the speed we benchmarked in RTX 4090.

| precision | realtime factor w/ compile | realtime factor w/o compile | VRAM |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `bfloat16` | x2.1 | x1.5 | ~10GB |
| `float16` | x2.2 | x1.3 | ~10GB |
| `float32` | x1 | x0.9 | ~13GB |

We will be adding a quantized version in the future.
