# Hindi Voice Cloning using Open-Source TTS Models

This repository contains experiments and findings from building a Hindi TTS voice cloning pipeline using open-source models like Nari-DIA 1.6B, Coqui XTTS, and Microsoft SpeechT5. The work focuses on evaluating zero-shot capabilities, fine-tuning using Hindi datasets, and addressing limitations in Hindi synthesis.

## üîç Models Explored

### 1. Nari-DIA 1.6B 
Original Repo for this model : https://github.com/nari-labs/dia.git
## üíª Hardware and Inference Speed

Dia has been tested on only GPUs (pytorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.6). CPU support is to be added soon.
The initial run will take longer as the Descript Audio Codec also needs to be downloaded.
